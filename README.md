# Map-Generator
This is a country map generator that uses machine learning to create the map, and then use the characteristics of the map to find things like the generated countries religion, population, and more!

Currently a WIP and should be finished by next week.

Currently uses the input of user Continant, population, and area.
Uses Co-lab and h5 for the model.
